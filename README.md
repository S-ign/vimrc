# vimrc
This is so I can set up my vim environment from anywhere easily.

----------------------------------
First get Vundle in home directory:
git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim

If this repository hasn't already been cloned do so:
git clone https://github.com/S-ign/vimrc

Copy this vimrc file to the home directory and rename it to .vimrc
cp vimrc ~/
mv ~/vimrc ~/.vimrc

Open it in vim and type:
:PluginInstall
